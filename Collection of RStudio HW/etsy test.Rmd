The data for the experiment is contained in the file "etsy test.csv". Use this data to produce an analysis in R or R markdown.  Be sure to annotate your analysis so you know what you did.  Then produce a slide deck from your analysis in R markdown to communicate your results and your recommendation.  Make sure to recommend one version and have an analysis to back that up.
