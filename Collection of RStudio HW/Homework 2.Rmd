```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      cache = TRUE,

1. An A/B test results in 18 successes in 223 trials for version A and 26 successes in 287 trials for version B.  What is the probability that the true proportion of version A is larger than the true proportion for version B. i.e. $P(p_a>p_b$)? Hint: Use the Beta-Binomial Model.

```{R}
n_sim <- 10000

a_posterior <- rbeta(n_sim, 18 + 1, 223 - 18 + 1)
b_posterior <- rbeta(n_sim, 26 + 1, 287 - 26 + 1)

prob_a_greater_b <- mean(a_posterior > b_posterior)

cat("Probability that p_a > p_b:", prob_a_greater_b)

```


[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) ran a test in July of 2019 to evaluate the addition of logos next to its booking options (see below):

The company ran the experiment for two weeks and among the various response was the average spend for each user.  Describe the treatment and response for this experiment.

2. What is the treatment and what is the response for the Booking.com experiment?
## The treatment is the addition of the logos next to the options when booking
## The Response is how much an avergae user spends


3. Read in the data from "booking.csv".  What is the average spend and standard deviation of spend for each version?  I find it best to use the `stringsAsFactors=TRUE` argument in my `read.csv()` statement here.

```{r}
df<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weeseml/ISA365/main/booking.csv")
head(df)

summary_stats <- df |>
  dplyr::group_by(variant) |>
  dplyr::summarize(
    average_spend = mean(user_spend),
    sd_spend = sd(user_spend)
  )

print(summary_stats)

```

4. Visualize the data by each variant.  Use any graph you feel shows the distribution of spend the best.  Comment on your findings.  

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(df, ggplot2::aes(x = variant, y = user_spend)) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Distribution of Spend by Variant", y = "User Spend", x = "Variant")

```



5. Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference in average spend for each variant.  

```{r}
t_test_result <- t.test(user_spend ~ variant, data = df)

ci_diff <- t_test_result$conf.int

cat("95% Confidence Interval for the difference in average spend:", ci_diff)

```


6. Give a sentence explaining that interval so that anyone can understand what the test results are showing. 
## The 95% confidence interval for the difference in average spend shows us that the range that we expect the difference in average spend to be between -5.577 and -0.2482



7. For the version with the highest spend, what spend can booking.com expect to see if they implemented the best version from above? Use a 95% confidence interval?  Hint: first use the `filter` command from `tidyverse` to make a data frame containing only the values from the best variant.  Then use `t.test` to perform a single sample test.


```{r}
best_variant <- summary_stats |>
  dplyr::filter(average_spend == max(average_spend)) |>
  dplyr::pull(variant)

best_variant_data <- df |>
  dplyr::filter(variant == best_variant)

t_test_best <- t.test(best_variant_data$user_spend)

ci_best <- t_test_best$conf.int

cat("95% Confidence Interval for the best variant's spend:", ci_best)

```


8. Interpret the interval above in a sentence that anyone from Booking.com can understand.
## The 95% confidence interval for the best version's spend provides a range within which Booking.com can expect the average spend per user to be between 11.32 and 15.12.
